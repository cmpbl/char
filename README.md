A terminal-based personal character sheet

BUGS:
--If retaining session data (CLEAN_START = 0), buffs don't show until a refresh

PENDING FEATURES:
--List buff impacts on activation selection screen (and maybe distinguish buff vs debuff)
--Quest/buff addition and activation from side-window rather than full view
--Add text-based version for simplified access (access w/ a cmd flag)
