## An RPG to maximize life

`char` is an RPG for life that tracks goals for everyday living, and allows you gauge your performance over time.

#Primary Menu

*QUESTS* are either one-time or repeatable goals. Achieving a goal will be credit any of several attributes with a time-decaying change (a goal's impact to attributes can be either positive or negative). An example of a repeatable quest is to meditate each day.

Within the *QUESTS* menu, you have the option to LOG a quest to track completion of a quest, ADD a quest, or return to the main menu.

Quests are configurable as either one-time or repeating, have descriptive user-provided names, have a custom attribute impact for one or more attribute-types, and are associated with an icon character.

When logging quests, choose among existing quests. Once you log a one-time quest it will disappear as an option.

*BUFFS* are persisting adjustments to attributes that are active until disabled. They are configured like quests, but are active until disabled and do not time-decay. They are visible below the character portrait as their associated icon character.

Multiple *VIEWS* are available. The ATTRIBUTES view is the default view, but other views allow for deeper inspection of specific attributes, or listing of active buffs.
